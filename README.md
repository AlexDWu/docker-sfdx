# tiny-sfdx
An attempt at a tiny image that can run `sfdx force:apex:test:run` and `sfdx force:lightning:test:run`. The lightning part is broken and I don't have time to fix it right now. Maybe has something to do with a Chrome bug. https://github.com/forcedotcom/LightningTestingService/issues/38#issuecomment-345542333 Maybe I look into configuring the Firefox driver.
